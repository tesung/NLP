### Question

What does the public think about NFTs? Which projects are trending? The goal is to find the hottest and most believed-in project based on community feedback.

### Data description

I downloaded a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavellexyr/the-reddit-nft-dataset). It is a .csv file with comments from reddit with the word 'NFT' in the comment body or in the title. This dataset has 10 columns and 2.4 million unique comments. 

### Tools

I plan to use NLP (tokenization, VADER), regular expressions, dimensionality reduction (not sure SVD or PCA), topic modeling (not sure exactly which technique yet), and sentiment ranking as techniques to clean and analyze the dataset. 

Use NLTK & Scikit learn & pandas
